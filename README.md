# SpaceshipTitanicBinaryClassification

This project is prepared for a Kaggle Competition called "Spaceship Titanic". I tried to solve a binary classification problem with Pandas Profiling as an EDA tool and AutoKeras algorithm. More details are given in the Jupyter Notebook. Kaggle competition and code links are given below.

If you found this project helpful, some Kaggle upvotes would be very much appreciated!
